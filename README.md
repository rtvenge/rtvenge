# 👋

My name is Ryan Tvenge (Tah-Ven-Nee) and I’m a Web Designer/Developer. I own a web studio called [Hoverboard](https://hoverboardstudios.com) where we create digital experiences for engaged companies.

I have extensive knowledge in:

* Front-End (html/css/js)
* Workflow tools like Grunt/Gulp.js, PostCSS, Docker, wp-cli, etc.
* WordPress
* Other backend languages like Python and Node.js.
* Other CMS’s such as Drupal

## You have to Embrace Change

What excites me most is how fast the web changes. I can’t wait to see what is new out there; how I can change the way we do things and interact with each other. That being said, you can’t jump on every new “shiny” thing. Making sure it’s going to be a viable technology for the long haul is key.

## Forward-Thinking & Creativity

I truly love what I do. The requirement of being a forward-thinker combined with being creative motivates me to do my best work.
